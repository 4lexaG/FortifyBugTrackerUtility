FoD Releases Source Configuration

    FortifyBugTrackerUtility can automatically select FoD releases to be processed, and map
releases to command line options, for example to map individual releases to corresponding
target projects. The following example shows a full bean definition, listing all available 
properties and corresponding description. Note that this bean is optional; if not defined 
the utility will process all releases unless specific releases are specified on the command line.
