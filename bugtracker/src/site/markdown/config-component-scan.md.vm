# component-scan element
Each configuration file must specify which source and target system to use through the `<context:component-scan>` element. This element has the following format:

`<context:component-scan base-package="com.fortify.bugtracker.src.[sourceSystem], com.fortify.bugtracker.tgt.[targetSystem]"/>`

- `[sourceSystem]` can be one of the following:
    - ssc
    - fod
- `[targetSystem]` can be one of the following:
    - archer
    - file
    - jira
    - octane
    - ado
    - ssc 
     
As an example, the following element would select FoD as the source system, and Jira as the target system: `#printTagByName("config/FoDToJira.xml" "context:component-scan")`

Note that each configuration file may only have one `<context:component-scan>` element that selects one source system and one target system. If you require multiple source/target system combinations, these should all have their own configuration file.
