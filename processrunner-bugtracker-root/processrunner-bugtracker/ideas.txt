FUNCTIONALITY:
- Add context property FoDReleases to specify one or more FoD Releases by name
  or id, similar to how this is implemented for SSC. 
  
- Add support for generating default values for FoD release id, similar to the functionality
  in com.fortify.processrunner.ssc.appversion
  
- Dynamically determine any extra data to be loaded from the source system (SSC/FoD), or implement
  functionality for loading this data on-demand (when it is actually accessed), to prevent users
  from having to manually configure which extra data needs to be loaded.
  Note that AbstractProcessorGroupByExpressions may serialize the grouped objects, which may
  result in all on-demand objects being loaded? 
  
- Create abstract superclass for ProcessorFileSubmitIssueForVulnerabilities, and create separate 
  subclasses for CSV and other file formats that can be written by Jackson (XML, JSON, ...). For
  each output format, create a separate configuration file.
  
CREDENTIALS HANDLING:  
- Add functionality for securely storing usernames and passwords in a password-protected persistent
  store. This way only the master password needs to be specified via command line or console at
  the start of the program, allowing the remainder of the program to run without user interaction
  to request usernames/passwords.
  
- Add support for Fortify pwtool to allow encoded passwords to be stored in the configuration
  file.
  
PERFORMANCE & MEMORY USAGE:
- Implement optional multi-threading to process multiple contexts in RunProcessRunnerFromSpringConfig
  Note that this may increase memory usage, especially when grouping is enabled.
  TODO: Check that IProcessor implementations do not store context-specific information as instance variables,
        since instance variables are shared between threads.
  TODO: How to properly handle FoD rate limiting if multiple threads access FoD?
  
- In AbstractProcessorUpdateIssueStateForVulnerabilities, persistently cache the issueData map after
  updating the bug tracker issue. If a cached entry exists and contents are the same, there is
  no need to send the updated fields to the bug tracker. 
  
- Instead of storing grouped source objects, change the API to store and update the generated fields
  map? This may result in less data being stored, and no issues when using on-demand objects (see
  above). If we do this, how do we pass the relevant vulnerability id's on to the IssueSubmittedListener?
  
- Have SSC/FoD return the vulnerabilities sorted or grouped based on the grouping criteria. This way
  we can process one group at a time, instead of having to temporarily store all vulnerability
  data to make sure we have collected all vulnerabilities for each group.
  
- Where possibly, only load required JSON fields from source and target systems, instead of full
  objects with all default fields
  
- Use SSC bulk requests to reduce the number of round trips, for example to include issue details
  when requesting application version issues, and including application version attributes when
  requesting application versions. Not sure whether this is actually possible.
  
MAINTENANCE:
- Define a common JSON data model for commonly used FoD and SSC vulnerability fields, such that
  we only need to define a single field mapping and grouping criteria that works for both FoD
  and SSC.

- We currently use different approaches for defining filters for vulnerabilities (via IProcessor
  implementations that get configured via an auto-wired configuration object) and application 
  versions/releases (via Filter classes that get auto-wired by Spring). Does it make sense to 
  refactor to use the same type of architecture for both? Note that submitVulnerabilities and
  updateVulnerabilities require different sets of filters, so may be more difficult to auto-wire
  all filters.
    
TODO: 
- Check the processing of initial context and mapped context properties for correct behavior.
  I.e. what functionality should use the initial context (for example with credentials to 
  access FoD/SSC), what functionality should use only the mapped context properties, and what
  functionality should use combined initial context and mapped context properties?
  (See IContextGenerator, IContextUpdater AbstractContextGeneratorAndUpdater, FoD/SSC-specific 
   implementations)
- Create repo's for fortify-maven-support and bugtracker-add-existing-bug, and commit code
- Code cleanup, resolve various TODO's documented in the code
- The XSLT to generate full configuration files replaces CDATA sections with XML-encoded data,
  reducing readibility of the generated configuration files. XSLT only allows predefined output
  elements to be output as CDATA sections (for example all <value> elements), so this probably 
  isn't suitable as too many elements would be output as CDATA sections. We have to find a better
  way to combine the partial configuration files, without reformatting any elements.
- Update README.md and Wiki
- Rename FoDBugTrackerUtility to FortifyBugTrackerUtility (as it now supports SSC), or even
  just 'FortifyUtility' as the generic architecture can support completely different use cases.
- Add configuration files for additional native SSC bug tracker integrations (SSCTo*ViaSSC.xml;
  see SSCToTFSViaSSC.xml for example)
