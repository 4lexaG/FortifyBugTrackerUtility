- Add context properties SSCApplicationVersion and FoDRelease to specify sources by name
  - For now, add a utility class like SSC/FoDConnectionFactory that has a private IContext interface
    that can hold either id or name (format Application:Version/Release) and a static
    getApplicationId(Context)/getReleaseId(context) method that either returns the provided
    id directly, or looks up the id for the provided name.
  - In the future, see whether we can integrate this in ContextProperty directly
    (i.e. allow to have an alternative context property (name) that sets another context property (id)
    
- Add support for specifying a mapping from one context property value to multiple other property values
  - For example given an FoD release name, set the corresponding JIRA project key
  - If FoDReleaseId is not specified, run the process runners for all FoDReleaseId's
    specified in this mapping
    
- Add support for ContextProperty instances to run some method to provide a default value
  (probably necessary for next point)
  
- Add support for loading additional context properties from SSC/FoD application (version) attributes,
  i.e. have an SSC application attribute containing the JIRA project identifier to which vulnerabilities
  for this application version need to be filed.
  If no SSC application version is provided, load all appversions for which this application attribute has been set
