- Add context properties SSCApplicationVersion and FoDRelease to specify sources by name
  - For now, add a utility class like SSC/FoDConnectionFactory that has a private IContext interface
    that can hold either id or name (format Application:Version/Release) and a static
    getApplicationId(Context)/getReleaseId(context) method that either returns the provided
    id directly, or looks up the id for the provided name.
  - In the future, see whether we can integrate this in ContextProperty directly
    (i.e. allow to have an alternative context property (name) that sets another context property (id)
    
- Add support for specifying a mapping from one context property value to multiple other property values
  - For example given an FoD release name, set the corresponding JIRA project key
  - If FoDReleaseId is not specified, run the process runners for all FoDReleaseId's
    specified in this mapping
  Essentially works, requires some more work
  Add implementations for getting all projects with for example 'JiraProjectKey' application version attribute set,
  and automatically map application version context property to jira project key context property
    
- Add support for ContextProperty instances to run some method to provide a default value
  For example to read usernames/passwords from console only once for all processor invocations


    
TODO: 
- create repo's for fortify-maven-support and bugtracker-add-existing-bug, and commit code
- Change add/getContextPropertyDefinitions to use a map of ContextPropertyDefinition instances indexed by name
  (to avoid duplicates from multiple processors)
- Check whether IContextAware is being used, otherwise remove this functionality as it complicates some code
